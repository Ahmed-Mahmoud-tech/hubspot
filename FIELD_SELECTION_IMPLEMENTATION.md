# Duplicate Contact Field Selection Implementation

## Summary

I've successfully implemented the field selection functionality for duplicate contact merging as requested. Here's what was added/modified:

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Field Selection Modal Component

**File:** `d:\marketing\marketing-f\src\app\duplicates\components\FieldSelectionModal.tsx`

- Created a new modal component that allows users to:
  - Select values for firstName, lastName, phone, and company fields from available options
  - Enter custom values for any field
  - Email fields are excluded as requested (cannot be selected or modified)
  - Shows radio buttons for each available value from all contacts in the group
  - Provides text input for custom values

### 2. Updated Duplicates Page

**File:** `d:\marketing\marketing-f\src\app\duplicates\page.tsx`

- Added field selection modal state management
- Modified `handleMergeClick` to open field selection modal instead of direct merge
- Added `handleFieldSelectionConfirm` function that:
  - Updates the primary contact in HubSpot with selected field values
  - Handles potential ID changes from HubSpot updates
  - Performs the merge with the updated primary contact
- Integrated the field selection modal into the JSX

### 3. Updated useRequest Hook

**File:** `d:\marketing\marketing-f\src\app\axios\useRequest.ts`

- Added `updateContact` function to call the new backend endpoint
- Added the function to the exported object

## Backend Changes

### 1. HubSpot Controller

**File:** `d:\marketing\marketing-b\src\controllers\hubspot.controller.ts`

- Added new `@Post('update-contact')` endpoint
- Accepts contactId, apiKey, and fields to update
- Calls the HubSpot service to update the contact

### 2. HubSpot Service

**File:** `d:\marketing\marketing-b\src\services\hubspot.service.ts`

- Added `updateContactInHubSpot` method
- Uses HubSpot's PATCH API to update contact properties
- Returns the updated contact data including any new ID

### 3. Merging Service

**File:** `d:\marketing\marketing-b\src\services\merging.service.ts`

- Fixed the merge loop issue by tracking the current primary ID
- Added `currentPrimaryId` variable that gets updated after each merge
- Ensures subsequent merges use the most recent primary contact ID
- Prevents errors when merging multiple contacts sequentially

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Field Selection UI:**

   - Radio buttons for each available field value from all contacts
   - Custom text input for new values
   - Email fields are read-only/not selectable
   - Clear visual distinction between different field options

2. **HubSpot Integration:**

   - Updates contact fields in HubSpot before merging
   - Handles ID changes that may occur from HubSpot updates
   - Uses HubSpot's official PATCH API for contact updates

3. **Improved Merge Logic:**

   - Tracks the primary contact ID throughout the merge process
   - Updates the primary ID after each individual merge
   - Prevents "contact not found" errors in multi-contact merges
   - Maintains data consistency between local database and HubSpot

4. **User Experience:**
   - Modal workflow for field selection
   - Clear indication of what fields can be modified
   - Validation and error handling
   - Progress feedback and success messages

## Flow

1. User selects primary contact from duplicate group
2. User clicks "Merge" button
3. Field selection modal opens showing all available field values
4. User selects desired values for firstName, lastName, phone, company
5. User can enter custom values if needed
6. User clicks "Proceed with Merge"
7. System updates primary contact in HubSpot with selected fields
8. System performs merge using the updated primary contact ID
9. System handles any ID changes from HubSpot updates
10. Process completes with success notification

## Technical Improvements

- **ID Tracking:** Fixed the issue where subsequent merges would fail due to outdated primary contact IDs
- **API Integration:** Proper use of HubSpot's contact update API
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling for both update and merge operations
- **Type Safety:** Proper TypeScript types for all new interfaces and functions
- **User Validation:** Plan limits and contact validation maintained

The implementation now allows users to fully customize the fields of the primary contact before merging, while preventing email modification and properly handling HubSpot ID updates during the merge process.
